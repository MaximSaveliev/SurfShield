# SurfShield
SurfShield is a desktop application developed using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) and C# programming language. It is designed to provide users with a secure and protected browsing experience by combining the functionalities of a VPN (Virtual Private Network) and a proxy server.
<h3>Key Features and Capabilities</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Privacy Protection: SurfShield ensures users' online privacy by encrypting their internet traffic and securely routing it through VPN servers or proxy servers, making it difficult for unauthorized entities to monitor or track their online activities.</li>
  <li>Anonymity and Geolocation Masking: SurfShield enables users to browse the internet anonymously, hiding their real IP address and providing the option to choose a different virtual location to access geo-restricted content.</li>
  <li>Versatile Browsing Options: Users can seamlessly switch between VPN and proxy modes within SurfShield, allowing them to adapt their browsing preferences based on their specific needs or requirements.</li>
</ul>
